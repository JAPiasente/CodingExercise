Instructions for use.

I have made it that api is preloaded with 5 investments. The investments are as follows.
Id	Name
1	PNC
2	Google
3	Microsoft
4	Apple
5	Peleton

When the api is started up by default it should return the investment id as well as the name of each investment in a list. (For me the url is https://localhost:44310/investments)
To query each of these investments to get the number of shares, cost basis per share, current value, current price, term, and total gain/loss, pass the investment id as a parameter
 (i.e. https://localhost:44310/investments/1 ) will get you the information for the PNC investment.

I have also written unit tests which can be run in the test explorer.

I hope I have met or exceeded your expectations.

Thank you for your time,

Joe Piasente
